# CosmWasm Security Spotlight

CosmWasm Security Spotlight is intended to be a series of medium posts about vulnerabilities found in audits of CW smart contracts. It would be a good starting point for anyone looking to get into CW contracts audits or to develop more secure smart contracts.

In addition, some hands-on labs are created so the reader can practice their bug hunting skills in easy targets. This series is being published in partnership with [Oak Security](https://www.oaksecurity.io/).

# Roadmap to CosmWasm Security/Auditing

The following is a list of interesting resources in case you want to start auditing [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) smart contracts. I have not personally reviewed some of the resources, but those have been useful to others in the past and therefore worthy of mention. 

 My recommended path looks like:
 1. Blockchain and smart contracts basics
 2. Rust lang
 3. CosmWasm
 4. CosmWasm Security


Do not hesitate to drop me a line if you have any personal favorite that you think should be listed or if you think some of the current additions are not worth of attention.


### Blockchain and smart contracts basics

You first need to be familiar with the basic concepts of blockchain technologies and smart contracts in general. I came from Solidity and Ethereum auditing myself, so not very sure what ones to recommend if you don´t have any experience… But I enjoyed [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) back in the day. You can probably find a lot of recommendations on this already :)


### Rust language

You don´t need a high level of Rust programming to start, which is quite challenging IMO, just to be able to clearly understand Rust code and create basic programms. For any question that could come to your mind during this journey, [the Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) will most likely be your bible.

There are a lot of free basic courses out there, for example: [Udemy: Ultimate rust crash course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/) and its second part [Ultimate rust 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-2/)
 
You can find easy code examples to follow or try to implement yourself at [https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/). There are a lot of additional sites with Rust exercises such as [Exercism's Rust path](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust)

[I loved Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), as you get to learn Rust by actually fixing code snippets that you have to previously understand which is quite similar to auditing in a sense. 


I sometimes use [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) as a quick ready to go environment to test ramdon stuff and behaviours.
   

### CosmWasm

At this point, you already have at least basic knowledge on blockchain techs, smart contracts and rust. It is about time to actually get into CosmWasm! There is a set of posts featured by Ethan Frey [(@ethanfrey)](https://github.com/ethanfrey) that are now outdated but could still give you a nice overview and comparison with other techs:
- [CosmWasm for Developers](https://blog.cosmos.network/cosmwasm-for-developers-7640ee38430f)
- [CosmWasm for CTOs 0](https://medium.com/cosmwasm/cosmwasm-for-ctos-f1ffa19cccb8), [I: the architecture](https://medium.com/cosmwasm/cosmwasm-for-ctos-i-the-architecture-59a3e52d9b9c), [II: adavanced usage](https://medium.com/cosmwasm/cosmwasm-for-ctos-ii-advanced-usage-ee04ce95d1d0), [IV: native integrations](https://medium.com/cosmwasm/cosmwasm-for-ctos-iv-native-integrations-713140bf75fc)


As CosmWasm is a Cosmos SDK module and therefore will run in Cosmos chains, you should first get familiar with how Cosmos works and some core concepts. You should at least read the following Cosmos documentation:
1. [Introduction section](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/intro/overview). Includes high-level overview, application-specific blockchains, blockchain architecture and main componentes of the Cosmos SDK.
2. [Basics section](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/basics/app-anatomy). Includes anatomy of a Cosmos SDK application, transaction lifecycle, query lifecycle, accounts and gas and fees.


NOW is when we start diving into CosmWasm itself. I would say just reading cover to cover the [CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/) is good starting point to get all the theretial concepts before trying to develop your own contracts. In addition, [this one resource](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/main/SEMANTICS.md) has been helpfull to me for quick references from time to time, some details are reflected on The Book but some others are not so clear to me there.


CosmWasm smart contract programming will be your next stop. You should be able to write CW smart contracts although not being a brilliant Rust developer, [CW Template](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template) is a nice resource to play around a bit. You can find a list of resources below, some of the content will overlap so the idead is not to do all of them but just to give more options
1. [CosmWasm zero to hero](https://github.com/Callum-A/cosmwasm-zero-to-hero)
2. [CosmWasm Academy](https://cosmwasm.getlearnworlds.com/)
3. [Area 52](https://area-52.io/)
4. [Terra academy: CosmWasm smart contracts I](https://academy.terra.money/courses/cosmwasm-smart-contracts-i)


[CosmWasm Plus](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus) is a set of publicly available base contracts of common implementations following the idea of [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts). Going over some of the main ones and understanding their architecture and behaviour is a good way to start testing your Smart Contract analysis game, your main skill as a future auditor.
- [CW20 fungible token](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/main/packages/cw20/README.md)
- [CW721 non-fungible token](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/main/packages/cw721/README.md)
- [CW1 fixed multisig](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/tree/main/contracts/cw3-fixed-multisig)


In addition, you should get familiar with Smart Contract testing as you will craft your own PoCs using these, check [Mastering CosmWasm Multi-Test](https://medium.com/obi-money/learn-cosmwasm-multi-test-easy-rust-smart-contract-apps-96818550ba3d) for a practical crash course on the topic. Further documentation on the most used libraries can be found at:
- [Module cosmwasm_std::testing](https://docs.rs/cosmwasm-std/latest/cosmwasm_std/testing/index.html)
- [Crate cw_multi_test](https://docs.rs/cw-multi-test/latest/cw_multi_test/), there is also a [chapter in the CW Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/basics/multitest-intro.html)


Getting familiar with [IBC in CosmWasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/main/IBC.md) is a good addition as it will become more and more common in CW contracts. Although not mandatory at this point as it is not a basic feature, you will have to go throught this sooner or later.


There is an additional framework from building CosmWasm smart contracts, [the Sylvia Framework](https://medium.com/cosmwasm/the-sylvia-framework-release-b4ffbb74fe3d) but to be honest I have never been asked to audits one of these so... not sure if this has actual community attention at the moment.


### CosmWasm security

Now you have all the prerequisites to get into the audit and security specifics of CosmWasm! If you come from Solidity auditing, the lack of resources here will surprise you compared to the overload of beginner security stuff for Sol/EVM out there.

First of all, as you may expect, the CosmWasm Security Spotlight posts that are listed at the beggining of this repo and any future ones in my [Medium @jcsec-audits](https://medium.com/@jcsec-audits). Then DAO DAO's [CosmWasm security best practices](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/wiki/CosmWasm-security-best-practices) have some interesting bits of info too.

The next stop is practical examples:
1. [Oak's CosmWasm Security Dojo](https://github.com/oak-security/cosmwasm-security-dojo). In addition to the challenges themselves, you will find an `EXPLAINATION.md` on each dir giving you further details and concepts that are very useful.
2. [DeFiVulnLabsCosmWasm](https://github.com/punishell/DeFiVulnLabsCosmWasm)


At the moment there is not many other good resources out there, so it is time to start reading CosmWasm audit reports. This is the best way to get familiar with the kind of security issues that we auditors find during out security reviews.

There are three companies that I know of that have multiple public reports of CosmWasm audits:
1. [Oak Security](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports)
2. [SCV Security](https://github.com/SCV-Security/PublicReports/tree/main/CW)
3. [Halborn](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/tree/master/CosmWasm%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits), although most of their reports are from the "Terra era"
