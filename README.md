# CosmWasm Security Spotlight

CosmWasm Security Spotlight is intended to be a series of medium posts about vulnerabilities found in audits of CW smart contracts. It would be a good starting point for anyone looking to get into CW contracts audits or to develop more secure smart contracts.

In addition, some hands-on labs are created so the reader can practice their bug hunting skills in easy targets. This series is being published in partnership with [Oak Security](https://www.oaksecurity.io/).
